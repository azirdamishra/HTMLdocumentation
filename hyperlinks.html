<p>the HTML anchor element is used to define both hyperlinks and anchors. <br> 
An anchor is a term used to define a hyperlink destination inside a document</p>
<br>
<p>URL stands for Universal Resource Locator, it refers to the address of the website. A typical website address starts with https://www.google.com</p>
<p>the href attribut of the defines the link address whereas the tag itself encloses text, image, gif etc which acts as the hyperlink.</p>
<p>
	<a href = https://www.google.co.in/> This text </a> is a link to google homepage.
</p>
<br>
<p>The target attribute defines where the linked document will be opened. If we set the target attribute to _blank the link will open in a new tab instead of the same one <br>
<a href="https://www.google.co.in/" target="_blank"> First Page </a>
</p>
<br>
<p>The name attribute is used for internal linking. When the name attribute is used then the anchor tab 'a' defines a named anchor inside and HTML document. Name anchors are not displayed in any special way. They are invisible to the reader.<br>
The # in the href attribute defines a link to a named anchor.  </p>
<br>
