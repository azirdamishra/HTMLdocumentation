			Color is a powerful communication tool and can be used to signal action, influence mood, and even influence physiological reactions.<br> Certain colors have been associated with
			<ul>
				<li>increased blood pressure</li>
				<li> increased metabolism</li>
				<li>eyestrain</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>Psychological effects of colour</h3>

			<p>While perceptions of color are somewhat subjective, there are some color effects that have universal meaning. 
				<br> Colors in the <u>red area of the color spectrum</u> are known as <b>warm colors</b>. They include <font color="red"> red </font>,<font color="orange">orange</font> , and<font color="yellow">yellow</font> . These warm colors evoke emotions ranging from feelings of warmth and comfort to feelings of anger and hostility.
				<br>
				<br>
				Colors on the <u>blue side of the spectrum</u> are known as <b>cool colors</b> and include<font color="blue"> blue</font>,<font color="purple"> purple</font>, and<font color="green"> green</font>. These colors are often described as calm, but can also call to mind feelings of sadness or indifference.</p>

				<h3>Using color for therapy</h3>
				<p align="justify">
					Several ancient cultures, including the Egyptians and Chinese, practiced chromotherapy, or the use of colors to heal.
					Chromotherapy is sometimes referred to as light therapy or colorology and is still used today as a holistic or alternative treatment. In this:
					<ol>
						<li>Red was used to stimulate the body and mind and to increase circulation.</li>
						<li>Yellow was thought to stimulate the nerves and purify the body.</li>
						<li>Orange was used to heal the lungs and to increase energy levels.</li>
						<li>Blue was believed to soothe illnesses and treat pain.</li>
						<li>Indigo shades were thought to alleviate skin problems.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Modern Research On color and Psychology</h3>

						<ol type="a">
							<li>One study found that warm-colored placebo pills were reported as more effective than cool-colored placebo pills.</li>
							<li>Anecdotal evidence has suggested that installing blue-colored streetlights can lead to reduced crime in those areas.</li>
							<li>More recently, researchers discovered that the color red causes people to react with greater speed and force, something that might prove useful during athletic activities.</li>
							<li>A study that looked at historical data found that sports teams dressed in mostly black uniforms are more likely to receive penalties and that students were more likely to associate negative qualities with a player wearing a black uniform.</li>
						</ol>
					
					<h3>Colors affect performance as well</h3>

					Studies have also shown that certain colors can have an impact on performance. No one likes to see a graded test covered in red ink, but one study found that seeing the color red before taking an exam actually hurt test performance.

﻿﻿					While the color red is often described as threatening, arousing or exciting, many previous studies on the 							impact of the color red have been largely inconclusive. The study found, however, that exposing students to the 					color red prior to an exam has been shown to have a negative impact on test performance.

					In the first of the six experiments described in the study, 71 U.S. colleges students were presented with a participant number colored either red, green or black prior to taking a five-minute test. The results revealed that students who were presented with the red number before taking the test scored more than 20 percent lower than those presented with the green and black numbers.
